I recently left Glitch where I had been an Staff level SRE for two years, and an engineering manager for the platform team for my last six months. I'm joining Gitpod as an SRE. I loved managing the platform team; .. but when joining a new company I found it much more comfortable to join as an IC. That's what i know best, that's where I feel safest. And with a small kid, not being overwhelmed by work is a high priority for me.

But that's not the topic of this post.

Before joining I thought a bit about how to get a bit of situational awareness once I joined, and how to figure out how best to contribute to the reliability of the platform.

So I came up with with list you see below. I'm sharing it here as I thought it might be interesting to people in other situations, and because I'd want to get feedback on it. When you're joining a new company as an SRE, what would you have on your list?

## Release process  

How do they release their software and at what cadence?

- CI
- Feature flags

## Observability

- Telemetry
- Tooling
- (telemetry checklist, naming conventions)

## Monitoring & alerting

- SLOs
- Alerting guidelines?
	How / Low urgency alerts

## Incident response

- On-call
- Run-books
- Playbook
- Retrospective docs  (if they have any, ask if they can point to interesting ones)
